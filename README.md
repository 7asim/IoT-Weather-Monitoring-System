An IoT Weather Monitoring System uses sensors to collect environmental data, a microcontroller to process the data, and a cloud platform to store and visualize the data. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it works:

Components:
Sensors: Devices like DHT22 and BMP180 measure temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure.
Microcontroller: A device such as an ESP8266 or ESP32 reads data from the sensors and sends it to the cloud.
Cloud Platform: Services like AWS IoT Core receive, store, and help visualize the sensor data.
Software: Code written in languages like C++ (for Arduino IDE) handles data collection, processing, and transmission.
